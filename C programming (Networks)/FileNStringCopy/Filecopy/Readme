To run
compile the filecopy_c
and run with ./a.out (file1) (file2) 
file1 is a fil you already have
file 2 is a file that will be created if not already there and file1 contents is in it

Screenshots attached are showing the two files being copied, they are also attached.

There is a problem where if you manipulate the file1 after copying to file 2 manually in a text editor it may not work. 
Basically just working to copy a file to another filename.
